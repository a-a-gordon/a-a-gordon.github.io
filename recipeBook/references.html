            <dl class="content_information"> 
                <dt> Element Made from Scratch </dt>
                <dd> For this project, I used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to create my logo that is featured in the top left corner of the navigation bar. It is a hand holding a spoon. I also made it clickable in order to always lead back to the 
                    homepage of my recipe website. </dd>

                <dt> Embedded Media </dt>
                <dd> For this project, my family and I filmed videos of making some of the more difficult dessert recipes (Papa Ben's Apple Pie and Papa Ben's Cinnamon Rolls). From there, I edited the videos together and made two complete follow-along style 
                    cooking videos. Both videos can be found either on the homepage after scrolling for an introduction, or on the desserts page for a more in depth recipe explanation. 
                </dd>

                <dt> CSS Image Rollover Effect </dt>
                <dd> 
                    For this project, I took my logo image and as it is hovered over, it not only increases in size slightly, but the opacity increases to make the image appear brighter. When clicked, it leads back to the homepage of the recipe website.
                </dd>

                <dt> JavaScript </dt>
                <dd> For this project, I was set on creating a filter/search bar that would allow to automatically (no submitting) filter recipes not just on the homepage, but on the appetizer, entree and dessert pages as well. I looked through multiple examples 
                    that didn't quite fit for what I was looking to accomplish, but after many attempts, I finally understood what the JavaScript was doing and created most of it on my own. I ran into difficulty with the contains() selector as it is case sensitive. 
                    Thus, I found a stack overflow source to help me create a new method, containi, that would essentially turn everything to uppercase. In total, my JavaScript searches for a match within the section html 5 semantic tag. If a match is not found, it hides 
                    that recipe from sight or brings it back when the filter to hide no longer applies. Thus, it allows me to filter/search recipes on each page. The source added to the work cited aspect of this page was the source that helped me to generate the containi 
                    function. The functionality to be able to search adds to the user experience as they do not have to scroll for a while to find a recipe that they may already have in mind. 
                </dd>

                <dd> I additionally created an automatic slideshow for my homepage to showcase some of the reciep highlights. This slideshow is based off of the example found on the w3 schools example with changes to detailing, such as removal of the 
                    page counter, shifting the dots that show what page a user is on, adding clickable links to the recipes being showed, and altering the CSS postion of the slideshow. It adds a nice professional look to the homepage and features inviting and appetizing 
                    recipes to draw new users in. The clickable text to the recipes also adds a flowing aspect to the site that enables users to reach certain locations in multiple fashions. All of the images in the slideshow have been compressed to the same size for even 
                    transitions.
                </dd>
            </dl>

            <h2 class="reference"> Project Summary </h2>
            <div class="project_summary"> 
                <p> I am very proud of the work I did on this project. I believe the design aesthetic, responsive web design, and functionality makes it not only inviting, adaptable, and useful, but also professional. To begin, I spent a good chunk of time figuring out 
                    what I wanted the site to look like as far as color scheme and layout. I knew right away that blues, white and gray could look elegant while also accentuating contrasting elements, such as the images, videos and logo. The layout on the appetizer, entree 
                    and dessert pages took quite a bit of time to figure out as there are flex boxes within other flexboxes and there is also an embedded grid element for the ingredients list. This additionally ties into another aspect of my design that I believe makes the functionality 
                    and adaptability of my website above and beyond. I made the website capable of handling three sized devices- desktop, tablet and personal phone. Even in between sizes, I utilized font-sizes and image-sizes that are relative to the viewport size so my website 
                    can change to most sizes and still look acceptable. At the main three sizing checks, flexboxes generally turn from a columnar layout to one displaying a row. The images on the appetizer, entree and dessert pages are compressed to be sized to the largest an image can appear 
                    on the site (about 630 pixels wide). The images displayed on the automatic slideshow are also compressed to have the same dimensions in order for smooth transitions. Additionally the navigation changes to make moving around the site still simple and easy. Functionality 
                    can also be found within the JavaScript I created for the filter bar. I spent hours figuring out how to make a search bar that would not only be able to search the entire section, but make the entire section disappear and reappear. At first, I had trouble as only a few 
                    elements would disappear while leaving others, or it would only search for the inputted keyword in a location or two, missing it somewhere else. But after figuring it out, I can say that the time spent was well worth it. The bar adds a touch of professional aesthetic 
                    alongside the automatic slideshow, another JavaScript element I added. Finally, I created extra media for the benefit of the users. I created two videos detailing difficult dessert recipes that a user could struggle with and created printable pdf versions of each recipe 
                    that can be reached at the click of a button. Overall I believe that the outcome of my site and the time and effort spent on making it is worthy of an A. 
                </p> 
                <p> There is always room for improvement and if I had more time, I would have explored the possibility of a collapsable recipe on the three main recipe pages (appetizer, entree and dessert). I believe this addition could have furthered the professional look of my 
                    site and made for easier searching capabilities. Additionally, I would have liked to be able to use my own pictures for the site as it would add to the auethetic feel. However, due to limited resources and time, I could not make all the recipes and take 
                    pictures as I would have liked. I am happy however that I at least had time to create the videos for two of the most challenging recipes.
